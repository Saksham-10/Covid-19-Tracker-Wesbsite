# Covid-19-Tracker-Wesbsite
This website is a mockup of https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
It uses already present APIs to fetch data and stats of COVID-19 from different parts of the world.
It can also function on VPNs, that is when you change the location the information and the graphs on the website change accroding the location you are at.
